# Thapar-Library-Seat-Search
A real-time system designed to improve the library experience by providing instant updates on seat availability, allowing users to efficiently find and secure seats without delays.

Real-time seat availability tracking, helping students and researchers plan study sessions more effectively.
Reduces time spent searching for seats and minimizes disturbance within the library.
Enhances seating capacity utilization and user experience.To implement the project, we propose installing touch-enabled monitoring screens where users can enter their roll number or scan their ID card. The system will display the library layout, with unoccupied seats highlighted in green and selected seats in red. Upon exit, seats are automatically marked as available once the user scans their ID. This reduces disturbance by allowing users to proceed directly to their chosen seat.

The system also provides academic institutions with valuable insights into seat occupancy, usage patterns, and user preferences, enabling more efficient resource planning and facility management.
